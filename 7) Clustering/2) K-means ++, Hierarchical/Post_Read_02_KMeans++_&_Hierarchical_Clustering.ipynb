    "\n",
    "- The silhouette score of a point **measures how close that point lies to its nearest neighbor points, across all clusters**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It provides information about clustering quality which can be used to determine whether further refinement by clustering should be performed on the current clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An instance’s silhouette coefficient is equal to $\\Large\\frac{(b – a)}{max(a, b)}$, where; \n",
    "\n",
    " - $a$ is the the mean intra-cluster distance (i.e., mean distance to the other instances in the same cluster)\n",
    "\n",
    " - $b$ is the nearest mean inter-cluster distance (i.e., the mean distance to the instances of the next closest cluster). It is defined such that the instance’s own cluster is excluding. \n",

    "**Q. What's the range of silhouette score?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The range of Silhouette score is [-1, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "- Score is $1$ when $b > a$ and $a = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - implying that the points in the same cluster are very close. \n",

    "- Ideally we want our Silhouette score to be closer to $1$, because we do want that our inter-cluster distances should be greater than intra-cluster distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is a more precise alternative to **Inertia (within cluster sum of squares (also called SSE))** and Elbow curve!\n",
    "\n",
    "- A more precise approach (but also more computationally expensive) is to use the silhouette score, which is the mean silhouette coefficient over all the instances. \n",

    "#### **Interpreting Silhouette scores**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A coefficient close to $+1$ means that the instance is well inside its own cluster and far from other clusters, \n",
    "\n",
    "- While a coefficient close to $0$ means that it is close to a cluster boundary, \n",
    "\n",
    "- A coefficient close to $–1$ means that the instance may have been assigned to the wrong cluster.\n",
